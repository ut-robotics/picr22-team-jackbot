17.okt (Karl Rahn)
3h Fixed the errors, asked for instructors to review the fixes, almost ready for milling.

20,21.okt (Karl Rahn)
8h started doing some other parts for the robot such as motor holders, camera holder, omniwheels.

31.okt (Matis and Karl Villers) Tested throwing balls from a ramp.
Code needs some additional time before being test ready. aprox 6h of coding time needed for an semi working code.

03.nov (Matis, Karl Villers, Karl Rahn) using the old model of ramp.
3h Milled out the new ramp
3h checked if the thrower ramp fit into the test robot assembly (it was ok).
Robot follows ball but one motor started jerking.
Need to be dismantled again

07.nov (Matis, Karl Villers, Karl Rahn, Nikita)
3h Testing out the new ramp, needs some sanding for rough edges, mostly okay. As well
2h Adjusted camera holder in fusion.
