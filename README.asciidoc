During the first 2 weeks of September, we together messed with assembling LeBot, programmers studied the code and mechanics/electronics were soldering different wires

1st September --- KarlR & KarlV 3h soldering battery connection wires. Nikita and Matis 3h were studying code and how to access the PC. 

5th September --- KarlR & KarlV 3h finished soldering wires, started assembling LeBot chassis and electronics. Matis and Nikita were working on the code already, making some 

9th September --- KarlR & KarlV 3h Finished assembling LeBot. Matis and Nikita were able to move the wheel motors for the first time.

12th September --- KarlR 2h started learing tools of Autodesk Fusion360. KarlV 3h was working on robot, tightening bolts and making sure that the pcbs will stay on the robot. Nikita and Matis 3h managed to move all the 3 wheels.

15th September --- KarlR 3h, managed to get his hands on Autodesk licence, making first sketches, still watching tutorials and LeBots designs. KarlV found some errors for the assemble, took it apart, fixed a soldering. Nikita and Matis were editing the code, making a structure for it.

19th September --- KarlR 3h, started making the Ball Thrower, taking measures from the ball and motor. KarlV 3h assembled the robot again and checked if more errors can be found. Matis and Nikita were able to move the 3 motors again and tried moving the thrower motor as well. 

22nd September --- KarlR 3h, worked on the design of the Ball Thrower. KarlV 3h, did some wire management, which meant that robot had to be disassembled again. Matis 3h was working on the camera thresholding, Nikita couldn't come that day.

26th September --- KarlR 2h, worked on the design of the Ball Thrower. KarlV couldn't attend the lesson. Matis 3h was working on the camera threshold, Nikita 3h was helping him with it.

29th September --- KarlR couldn't attend the day, though he improved the design at home approximately for 4h or so. KarlV 3h was helping Nikita and Matis for reviewing the work of motors.

3rd October --- KarlR 2h, improved the ball thrower. KarlV 3h worked on the camera position. Matis and Nikita 3h were trying to move the robot for the first time in action.

6th October --- KarlR 3h, made some last edits for the ramp. KarlV reviewed the movement of LeBot, tightened the wheel bolts. Nikita and Matis 3h made the robot to follow the ball.    

10th October --- KarlR 2h, tried to print out the parts for ball thrower. KarlV assembled the parts and then tested the thrower with Matis and Nikita (3h). Turned out that the ramp's angle was too steep, which meant that new ramp should be made.  

13th October --- KarlR 3h, tried fixing the ramp's angle, improved the thrower a bit and found out that it's better to use a miller for manufacturing the ramp. KarlV and programming team was trying to work with the printed ramp (3h).  

17th October --- KarlR 3h made the manufacturing model ready, although he couldn't mill out the updated thrower due to queue to the milling machine. KarlV couldn't attend the day. Matis and Nikita 3h were making some major changes to the code to run smoother.

20th October --- Karl 3h fixed the design, fixed the manufacturing model and the thrower should be milled out next time. KarlV 3h was helping to measure some distances with Nikita and Matis. 

24th October --- Karl 3h fixed the design of the ball thrower and managed to mill out the new parts for the ball thrower. KarlV with Nikita and Matis 3h tested the new ramp and was working quite okay.    

27th October --- KarlR 4h started making new robot, the JackBot 1.0. KarlV 3h worked on the equation for the motor to throw the balls (made statistics). Matis and Nikita assisted him during his time at the school.

31st October --- KarlR 2h made motor holders ready, started making some wheel designs. KarlV, Matis, Nikita were trying to make some code improvements for orbiting and moving around.

3rd November --- KarlR started making camera holder design, had some ides for omniwheel designs. KarlV started making programming, changing most of the code to universal. Matis and Nikita were missing that day.

7th November --- 2h KarlR improved omniwheel design, improved camera holder design, started making JackBot 1.0 chassis design with KarlV's given measurements. 3h KarlV was working on orbiting problem, Matis worked on thresholding, Nikita was studying home for a big test.

10th November --- 5h KarlR made some major design improvements for the whole new robot and asked some instructions from the instructors and teachers. KarlV 5h worked mainly on the code with Matis and also tried to qualify with the robot. Nikita was studying some of the schematics things with KarlR 3h.  

14th November --- 5h KarlR finished making the first prototype design for the robot, maybe needs some modifying. 3h KarlV and Matis were working on the programming and movement, made a new equation for the ball throwing. 2h Nikita was studying the code made by Matis and Karl

17th November --- 6h KarlR made some minor changes for the new robot, started making electronics schematic and made some component symbols and footprints, teached Nikita how to do things in Altium (although Nikita was more familiar with easyEDA so KarlR suggested him using that platform). KarlV and

21st November --- KarlR 6h, KarlV 6h, Nikita 3h, Matis 4h: KarlR improved the design of the JackBot, almost ready for manufacturing, Nikita started making a design of schematic (improved KarlR's scheme), Matis improved the equations for throwing the ball, KarlV milled out motor mounts and approved the orbiting code.                

24th November --- KarlR 5h printed out the wheels and made a beautyrim, as well printed out the battery holders. 3h KarlV and Matis were trying to fix the orbiting problem for the robot. Nikita 4h improved the scheamtic with KarlR advice.

28th November --- KarlR, KarlV, Matis, Nikita
