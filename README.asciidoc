27.okt (Karl Rahn)
3h finished making omni wheel design, printed out the first version, but it was broken and unable to add rollers.

28.okt (Karl Rahn)
1.5h Fixed errors, made a body split different way, also made a beautyrim for the wheel, which is removable.

31.okt
2h Made last fixes, asked for a review from instructors.

06.Nov
1h Added missing rollers, also made the wheel mount and wheel holes to be closer to each other.

07.Nov
2h Maybe printing out the new omniwheels and beautyrims.

Camera holder: Made by Karl Rahn, tested by Matis, Karl Villers and Nikita.

03.nov (Karl Rahn) 
Made 1st version of camera holder, was not practical.

07.nov (Karl Rahn)
Made 2nd version of camera holder, probably better version, adjusted the RGB sensor to middle, asked for review.
(Matis Vahter) Me, Karl Villers and Nikita tested robots moving capabilities and did setup to prepeare for thursday.

08.nov (Karl Rahn, Matis, Nikita, Karl Villers)
7h Improved some mechanics, made a calculation to calculate the thrower motor speed for shooting ball from different ranges.

09.nov (Karl Rahn, Matis, Karl Villers)
7h Improved the code, algortithms were scuffed.

10.nov (Whole team)
Tried to qualify to the competition, unfortunately our bot was not working correctly, didn't know how to make fixes during that current time, will make new orbit code.

14.nov (whole team) 
Presentation setup and Villers worked on robot to improve / remake
Printing logics, needs testing

During the first 2 weeks of September, we together messed with assembling LeBot, programmers studied the code and mechanics/electronics were soldering different wires

1st September KarlR & KarlV 3h soldering battery connection wires. Nikita and Matis 3h were studying code and how to access the PC. 

5th September  KarlR & KarlV 3h finished soldering wires, started assembling LeBot chassis and electronics. Matis and Nikita were working on the code already, making some 

9th September  KarlR & KarlV 3h Finished assembling LeBot. Matis and Nikita were able to move the wheel motors for the first time.

12th September KarlR 2h started learing tools of Autodesk Fusion360. KarlV 3h was working on robot, tightening bolts and making sure that the pcbs will stay on the robot. Nikita and Matis 3h managed to move all the 3 wheels.

15th September KarlR 3h, managed to get his hands on Autodesk licence, making first sketches, still watching tutorials and LeBots designs. KarlV found some errors for the assemble, took it apart, fixed a soldering. Nikita and Matis were editing the code, making a structure for it.

19th September KarlR 3h, started making the Ball Thrower, taking measures from the ball and motor. KarlV 3h assembled the robot again and checked if more errors can be found. Matis and Nikita were able to move the 3 motors again and tried moving the thrower motor as well. 

22nd September KarlR 3h, worked on the design of the Ball Thrower. KarlV 3h, did some wire management, which meant that robot had to be disassembled again. Matis 3h was working on the camera thresholding, Nikita couldn't come that day.

26th September KarlR 2h, worked on the design of the Ball Thrower. KarlV couldn't attend the lesson. Matis 3h was working on the camera threshold, Nikita 3h was helping him with it.

29th September KarlR couldn't attend the day, though he improved the design at home approximately for 4h or so. KarlV 3h was helping Nikita and Matis for reviewing the work of motors.

3rd October KarlR 2h, improved the ball thrower. KarlV 3h worked on the camera position. Matis and Nikita 3h were trying to move the robot for the first time in action.

6th October KarlR 3h, made some last edits for the ramp. KarlV reviewed the movement of LeBot, tightened the wheel bolts. Nikita and Matis 3h made the robot to follow the ball.    

10th October KarlR 2h, tried to print out the parts for ball thrower. KarlV assembled the parts and then tested the thrower with Matis and Nikita (3h). Turned out that the ramp's angle was too steep, which meant that new ramp should be made.  

13th October KarlR 3h, tried fixing the ramp's angle, improved the thrower a bit and found out that it's better to use a miller for manufacturing the ramp. KarlV and programming team was trying to work with the printed ramp (3h).  

17th October KarlR 3h made the manufacturing model ready, although he couldn't mill out the updated thrower due to queue to the milling machine. KarlV couldn't attend the day. Matis and Nikita 3h were making some major changes to the code to run smoother.
