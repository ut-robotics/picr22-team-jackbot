Ball thrower : Made by Karl Rahn, tested by Karl Villers, Matis and Nikita


19.sept Karl Rahn
3h of making sketches, watching tutorials and reccommendations for Fusion 360.

21.sept (Karl Rahn)
1h made fixes to sketches

22.sept
3h finished sketches, made parts to assemble the ramp

26.sept (Karl Rahn and Karl Villers)
3h assembled the thrower ramp in Fusion, made some fixes

3,4.okt (Karl Rahn)
6h major fixes to ramp walls.

10,12.okt (Karl Rahn)
5h Printed out the first version of the ramp and tested. Found out that, there are some errors and need to make new walls.

17.okt (Karl Rahn)
3h Fixed the errors, asked for instructors to review the fixes, almost ready for milling.

20,21.okt (Karl Rahn)
8h started doing some other parts for the robot such as motor holders, camera holder, omniwheels.

31.okt (Matis and Karl Villers) Tested throwing balls from a ramp.
Code needs some additional time before being test ready. aprox 6h of coding time needed for an semi working code.

03.nov (Matis, Karl Villers, Karl Rahn) using the old model of ramp.
3h Milled out the new ramp
3h checked if the thrower ramp fit into the test robot assembly (it was ok).
Robot follows ball but one motor started jerking.
Need to be dismantled again

07.nov (Matis, Karl Villers, Karl Rahn, Nikita)
3h Testing out the new ramp, needs some sanding for rough edges, mostly okay. As well
2h Adjusted camera holder in fusion.

Omni-wheel: Made by Karl Rahn, tested by Matis, Karl Villers and Nikita

20.okt (Karl Rahn)
3h Started making omniwheel design.

21.okt (Karl Rahn)
2h made some circular pattern designs, added metal pieces to hold rollers.

27.okt (Karl Rahn)
3h finished making omni wheel design, printed out the first version, but it was broken and unable to add rollers.

28.okt (Karl Rahn)
1.5h Fixed errors, made a body split different way, also made a beautyrim for the wheel, which is removable.

31.okt
2h Made last fixes, asked for a review from instructors.

06.Nov
1h Added missing rollers, also made the wheel mount and wheel holes to be closer to each other.

07.Nov
2h Maybe printing out the new omniwheels and beautyrims.

Camera holder: Made by Karl Rahn, tested by Matis, Karl Villers and Nikita.

03.nov (Karl Rahn) 
Made 1st version of camera holder, was not practical.

07.nov (Karl Rahn)
Made 2nd version of camera holder, probably better version, adjusted the RGB sensor to middle, asked for review.
(Matis Vahter) Me, Karl Villers and Nikita tested robots moving capabilities and did setup to prepeare for thursday.

08.nov (Karl Rahn, Matis, Nikita, Karl Villers)
7h Improved some mechanics, made a calculation to calculate the thrower motor speed for shooting ball from different ranges.

09.nov (Karl Rahn, Matis, Karl Villers)
7h Improved the code, algortithms were scuffed.

10.nov (Whole team)
Tried to qualify to the competition, unfortunately our bot was not working correctly, didn't know how to make fixes during that current time, will make new orbit code.

14.nov (whole team) 
Presentation setup and Villers worked on robot to improve / remake
Printing logics, needs testing
